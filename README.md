##  GrayScale using weighted averages
- Converting a color image into a Grayscale image using weighted averages
- Averages are Red = 0.299, Blue = 0.587, and Green = 0.114.

## Thresholding
- Image thresholding is a simple form of image segmentation. 
- It is a way to create a binary image i.e., a black and white image from a grayscale or full-color image.

## Padding
- Padding basically extends the area of an image in which a convolutional neural network processes. 
- Using numpy arrays to perform padding or BORDER_CONSTANT built-in function

## Blurring
- Blurring an image is a process that makes the image less sharp and reduces its level of detail.
- Using uniform distribution kernel ([1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]) to blur the image.

## Sharpening
- Image sharpening encompasses any enhancement technique that highlights the edges and fine details of an image.
